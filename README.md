# Satellite-Image-Classification-and-Urban-Growth-Modelling
Using Landsat-5 data along with it's classified image, I trained an ANN model which classifies into four classes of built-up, vegetation, barren lands
and water bodies. 
We are using this classifier to generate Land Use/Land Cover(LULC) classification maps for different years. In this instance, I have used,
2013 satellite image of Bangalore data to generate a LULC map for 2011
